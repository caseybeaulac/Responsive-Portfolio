            My name is Casey, I was born and raised in Montreal, Canada where I
            spent most of my life. I graduated highschool in 2012 and immediatly
            went to college to study in social sciences. After a little over a
            year I decided to drop out. This program was not for me. I decided
            to jump into a coding class, something I had never done before.
            <br />
            <br />
            After 3 years of writing lines and debugging I finally finished this
            program and did an internship for 2 months to aquire external
            experience. The internship went very well but unfortunatly the
            company did not had the budget to hire me. A few month later, I
            decided to pack my things and drive down to Orlando where I now
            live.

            Here I am, taking this new coding class to improve my skills even
            further and potentialy launch my career as a full-stack developer.
            But for now I currently work as a server in a wine bar downtown
            Orlando trying to make the best out of it. Oh and this is a picture
            of my cat (who is also Canadian).
